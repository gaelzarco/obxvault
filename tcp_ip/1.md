## Introduction

#protocol #protocolsuite #arpanet #catenet #arpanetreferencemodel

**Protocol** - The official procedure or system of rules governing affairs of state or diplomatic occasions.
- Set of common behaviors used with a common language.

**Protocol Suite** - Collection of related protocols.

**Architecture (Reference Model)** - The design that specifies how a _protocol suite_ relates protocols to each other and divide up tasks to be accomplished.

TCP/IP is a protocol suite that implements the internet architecture and draws its origins from the _ARPANET Reference Model (ARM) [RFC0871]._
- Other protocol architectures: XNS, SNA, ISO

TCP/IP evolved from the need to provide interconnection of multiple _different_ packet-switched
computer networks.
- Accomplished through the use of _gateways_ (_routers_) that provided a translation function between each incompatible network.
	- Became the concatenated network or _catenet_ (_inter-network_).

## Architectural Principles

#opensystem #wan #wideareanetwork

TCP/IP is an _open system_, many of its implementations are publicly available.
- Forms the basis for the **Internet** which is a _wide area network_ (_WAN_). 
- WWW is an application that uses the internet for communication.

**Primary Goal**: To develop multiplexed utilization of existing interconnected networks.

**Secondary Goals**:
- Communication must continue despite loss of networks or gateways.
- Support many types of communication services.
- Must accommodate a variety of networks.
- Permit distributed management of its resources.
- Must be cost-effective.
- Must permit host attachment with a low level of effort.
- Resources must be accountable.

### Packets, Connections, and Datagrams

Concept of networks was based on telephone networks.
- Connection was made between two users and cleared after call ended. Endpoints were used to calculate costs.

**Packet Switching**: "chunks" (_packets_) of data compromised of bytes being carried through the network independently.
- **Multiplexing**: The act of mixing and pulling apart chunks of data from different senders.
- Chunks can be moved around from one switch to another.
- Path was subject to change.

Advantages of _multiplexing_:
- Network is more resilient to physical attacks.
- Better utilization of network links and switches (_statistical multiplexing_).

Packets received at a switch -> Stored in _buffer memory_ or _queue_ -> Processed **FIFO** order.
- FIFO + scheduling combined to implement statistical multiplexing.
- Primary method to intermix traffic from different sources from the Internet.

**Statistical Multiplexing**:
- Traffic mixed together based on arrival stats or timing pattern of traffic.
- Simple and efficient - High utilization at every bottleneck.
- Downsides: Limited predictability - shared network with many applications.

Other methods:
- **Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)** 
- **Static Multiplexing**
- Typically reserve an amount of time for other resources on each connection (think constant-bit rate phone calls).
- Full extent of bandwidth may not be used, but more predictability.

**Virtual Circuits (VCs)**: Circuits that do not depend on physical circuit switches implemented using connection-oriented packets.
- X.25 -> Frame Relay -> **Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)** + cable modems.

**Connection-Oriented Networks (1960's)**:
-  _state_ is stored in each switch for each connection.
- X.25: _logical channel identifier_ & _logical channel number_ used with _per-flow_ state in each switch to determine next switch along the path for packets.
	- Per-flow state established prior to data exchange.
- Most prevalent form of networking.

__Datagram (1960's)__: Packet that houses all destination and origin info within the packet itself (opposed to in the switch).
- Larger packets
- Enabled **Connectionless** networks - eliminating signaling protocol.
- **Message Boundaries** or **Record Markers** (_Figure 1.1_).
	- Datagrams have a beginning and end.
- Circuit or VC networks do not preserve message boundaries.
	- Applications need to provide their own.

### End-to-End Argument and Fate Sharing

#endtoend #fatesharing

**End-to-End Argument**:
- Influenced the design of TCP/IP suite.
- Argues that functions (error control, delivery, encryption, acknowledgement) should not be implemented at low-levels (layers) of large systems.
- Low-levels can reduce the load on endpoints and improve performance.
	- Low-level functions should not aim for perfection. Applications need different things and attempting to encapsulate everything is doomed for incompleteness.
- _Dumb_ network and _smart_ systems.
- Many functions implemented in the end hosts where applications reside.

**Fate Sharing**: Store active communication association state (_virtual connection_) at the same place within communicating endpoints.
- Communication can only be destroyed at the endpoints
- Enables virtual connections (implemented by TCP) to stay active even if network connectivity has failed for an extended period of time.

What functions reside on network vs what does not is ongoing.

### Error Control and Flow Control

#errorcontrol #besteffortdelivery #flowcontrol

**Error Control** can be implemented in network infra or in systems connected to the network.
- _Recall: end-to-end argument/fate sharing and how it applies here._
- Involves codes to detect and repair bit errors when data is received or in-transit.
- Entire packets can be re-sent if more severe packet damage occurs.

VC networks handle retransmission within the network.
- Allows for error-free delivery of data but some apps do not require this.
	- Leads to increase cost due to potential re-transmission delays.

**Best-Effort Delivery**:
- Adopted by Frame Relay and the Internet protocol.
- Network does not expend large resources to ensure data is delivered without errors.
- Certain errors detected using _checksums_ -> erroneous datagrams discarded without further action.
- Enables data senders to send at a rate faster than the receiver's ability to parse it.

Slowing down a sender is done through **Flow Control**.
- Implemented outside the network at higher levels of the communication system.
- TCP handles this type of problem, consistent with end-to-end argument.
	- Handles rate control
	- Resides at end hosts
	- Allows elements of network infra to fail without affecting device communication outside the network.

## Design and Implementation

#protocolarchitecture #implementationarchitecture

Protocol architecture V.S. **Implementation Architecture**
- The latter defines how the protocol architecture is actually implemented.
- Implementing protocols for ARPANET resulted in network design philosophy involving multiple layers of implementation (and design) called **Layering**.

Layering is the default approach to implementing protocol suites.

### Layering

Each layer is responsible for a different facet of communications.
- Enables developers to build different portions separately.

**Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model** (Figure 1.2)
- Defined by _International Organization for Standardization (ISO)_.

![[Pasted image 20251028012945.png]]
_Figure 1.2 - OSI Model_
- _Physical_ layer describes methods of moving information across communication mediums such as a phone line or fiber-optic cable (Ethernet and Wireless LAN Wi-Fi).
- _Link_  (_Data-Link_) layer includes methods for establishing connectivity with another device.
	- Some link-layers (DSL) only connect two devices.
	- When more than one device can access the network -> _multi-access_ network.
- _Network_ (_Internetwork_) layer is epic.
	- For packet networks (TCP/IP), it provides an interoperable packet format that can use other types of link-layer networks for connectivity.
	- Also includes an addressing scheme for hosts and routing algorithms that choose where packets go when sent from one machine to another.
