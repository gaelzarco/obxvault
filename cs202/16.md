## Searching, Sorting & `std::vector` Type

#vector #search #sort

### List Processing

#list #array

**List**: Collection of values of the same type.
**Array**: Convenient place to store a list.

List of ops:
- Search the an item
- Sort the list
- Insert an item
- Delete an item
- Print the list

### Sequential Search

#sequentialsearch

**Sequential Search** algorithm:
- Searches a list by comparing each el, one by one to the target.
- Requires half the number of els in the list for a successful search.
- Does not require list to be sorted.
	- If sorted -> [[16#Binary Search|Binary Search (16)]]

Steps:
1. Start at the first element of the list.
2. Compare each element in the list with target val.
3. Continue until:
	- Target found
	- Target could not be found

### Binary Search

#binarysearch

Much faster than sequential search, especially for large lists.
- List must be sorted.

[[15#Divide-and-Conquer Algorithm(s)|Divide-and-Conquer (15)]] Approach:
- Compare the target val with the middle el.
- If target < middle el -> search lower half of list.
- is target > middle el -> search upper half of list.

#### Performance

For a sorted list of length $n$, the max number of comparisons is $O(\log n)$.
- Each iteration halves the size of the list.

### Selection Sort

#selectionsort

**Selection Sort**: Algorithm that rearranges a list by repeatedly finding the smallest el in the unsorted position and moving it to the correct spot.

Steps:
- Find the smallest el in unsorted portion of list.
- Move it to the beginning of the unsorted position by swapping the el currently there.
- Repeat with next smallest el in remaining unsorted els until list is fully sorted.

For int arr[5] = {5, 3, 4, 1, 2};
1. Pass 1: Find smallest el (1) and place it at the start.
	-  After Pass 1: {1, 3, 4, 5, 2}
2. Pass 2: Find next smallest el (2) and place it in the second position.
	-  After Pass 2: {1, 2, 4, 5, 3}
3. Pass 3: Find next smallest el (3) in the unsorted portion.
	- After Pass 3: {1, 2, 3, 5, 4}
4. Pass 4: Move last unsorted el (4) into position, completing the sort.
	- After Pass 4: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
