## Lysistrata Notes

Aristophanes sought to vindicate all individual freedoms and to eliminate the inhumanities of life. He was not interested in a utopian society where efforts were focsed on turning life into a social, economic, or moral abstraction.

He wished for life to be an adventure in stability and adventure.

### Discussion Board Response:

The ideas presented in the play were ironic in the way that the women approached a strategy to end the war; that is, they became masaculine themselves by exploiting the traditional stereotypes of women. They began sexualizing and exploiting one another from a masculine perspective. The women were hesitant to proceed with Lysistrata's plan, but ultimately formed a collective mind with a central leadership role, filled by Lysistrata. Her role forced her to reject her own desires and exploit the other women's sexuality in order to achieve peace. I found amusement in how Aristophanes treaded on the border of this dichotomy. Considering the information regarding Aristophanes in the Foreward of the play, this overarching theme perfectly aligns with his ideals. He believed firmly in vindicating all individual freedoms and not consolidating a person's life to a moral, political, or ethical abstraction. Lysistrata weaponized stereotypes and the women she gathered to achieve peace with little concern for the ethics surrounding her strategy. She merely sought to remove the inhumanities of war for the sake of leading a better, free life; and by doing so, she achieved the joyful adventure for happiness that Aristophanes was an advocate for.
