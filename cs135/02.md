# Basic Elements of C++

A __Computer Program__ is a sequence of statements that accomplish a task.

__Programming__ is a process of planning and creating a program.

## C++ Programs

Example of C++ _output_ statement:
```C++
cout << "Program to compute and output the perimeter and "
<< "area of a rectangle." << endl;
```

A program can contain various types of expressions such as arithmetic and strings.
    - Double quotes indicate a _String_.
    - String evaluate to itself.

`endl` causes the insertion point to move to the beginning of the next line.

Considering the following statement:
```C++
cout << "Length = " << length << endl;
```
The output consists of 2 expressions
    1. The first is `Length = "` (evaluates to itself)
    2. The second is `length` (identifier that evaluates to whatever length is)

A C++ program is a collection of functions, with a `main` function.
    - __Function__ is a set of statements that accomplish something.
    - the `main` function is required and is present in all C++ programs.

`//` Denote comments that are for the user.

The following line:
```C++
#include <iostream>
```
Enables us to use `cout` to generate the output and `endl`

```C++
using namespace std;
```
Allows us to use predefined objects or other methods without the prefix `std::`

```C++
int main()
```
Is the heading of the `main` function. The `{` that preceeds it marks the begining of the body of the function. `}` matches this brace and closes the body.

`<<` is an operator known as the _stream insertion operator_.

The following is a completed C++ program:
```C++
//**************************************************************
// Given the length and width of a rectangle, this C++ program
// computes and outputs the perimeter and area of the rectangle.
//**************************************************************

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    double length;
    double width;
    double area;
    double perimeter;

    cout << "Program to compute and output the perimeter and "
    << "area of a rectangle." << endl;

    length = 6.0;
    width = 4.0;
    perimeter = 2 * (length + width);
    area = length * width;

    cout << "Length = " << length << endl;
    cout << "Width = " << width << endl;
    cout << "Perimeter = " << perimeter << endl;
    cout << "Area = " << area << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
Variable Declarations:
```C++
    // Allocates memory space and gives it respective name
    double length;
    double width;
    double area;
    double perimeter;
```
Assignment statements:
```C++
    length = 6.0; // Stores 6.0 in memory space `length`

    area = length * width; // Evaluates length * width and stores result in memory space `area`
```
Output of the program:
```
Program to compute and output the perimeter and area of a rectangle.
Length = 6
Width = 4
Perimeter = 20
Area = 24
```

__Variables__ allocate memory and give a name to the address.

## The Basics of A C++ Program

__Function__ is a collection of statements that when executed, accomplishes a task.
	- Some _predefined_ or _standard_ functions are already written and are a part of the system.

__Main__ function is mandatory.

__Syntax Rules__ tell you which statements are legal or valid.
	- __Semantic Rules__ determine the meaning of instructions.

A __Programming Language__ is a set of rules, symbols, and special words.

### Comments

Comments are for the reader, not the compiler.
	- Completely ignored by compiler.

Single-line comments begin with `//`

Multi-line comments begin with `/*` and are closed with `*/`

#### Special Symbols

__Token__  is the individual unit of a program written in any language.

Math:
	`+`
	`-`
	`*`
	`/`

Semicolons end a C++ statement `;`

Considered a single symbol:
	`<=`
	`!=`
	`==`
	`>=`

No character can come between two characters in a token, not even a blank.
	- Blanks are considered tokens

#### Reserved Words

Second category of tokens are reserved word symbols:
	- `int`
	- `float`
	- `double`
	- `char`
	- `const`
	- `void`
	- `return`

__Keywords__ is a name for reserved words.
	- Always made up of lower-case letters.
	- Immutable

#### Identifiers

Third category of tokens.

They are names of things that appear in a program
	- Variables, constants, and functions

__Identifiers__ consist of letters, digits, and underscore characters.
	- Begin with letter or underscore.
	- Some are predefined, others are defined by user.
	- No other symbols are permitted.

#### Whitespaces

Includes blanks, tabs, and newline characters.
	- Used for separation.

### Data Types

A C++ program's main objective is to manipulate data.

__Data Type__ is a set of values together with a set of allowed operations.

Data type categories:
	- Simple
	- Structured
	- Pointers

#### Simple Data Types

Categories:
	- __Integral__ deals with integers and whole numbers
	- __Floating Point__ deals with decimals
	- __Enumeration__ is a user-defined data type

Integrals include:
	`char`
	`short`
	`int`
	`long`
	`bool
	`unsigned char`
	`unsigned short`
	`unsigned int`
	`unsigned long`
	`long long`
	`unsigned long long`

Every data type has different set of values associated with it.

Integral data type memory allocations:

_Different compilers may allow different ranges._

#### `int` Data Type

Includes positive and negative numbers

#### `bool` Data Type

true or false

#### `char` Data Type

Single characters such as letters, symbols and digits.
	- Enclosed in single-quotes.
	- Blank spaces written as `' '` (space between quotes).
	
__Collating Sequence__ is the predefined ordering represented by the numeric value associated to character (ASCII).
	- Used to compare characters.

The 14th character in ASCII is the newline character `\n`.
	- Treated as one character.
	- Horizontal tabs are represented as `\t`.
	- Null is represented as `\0`
	- First 32 characters are non-printable.

##### Floating-Point Data Types

__Floating-Point Notation__:
![[Pasted image 20250207182836.png]]

Data types:
	`float`
	`double`
	`long double`

`float` represents decimal values between `-3.4 * 10^38` and `3.4 * 10^38`
	- Four bytes are allocated

`double` represents decimal values between `-1.7 *  10^308` and `1.7 *  10^308`
	- Eight bytes are allocated

The max and min values of these data types are system dependent.
	- Check compiler documentation

Max number of significant digits (number of decimal places) in `float` is 6 or 7.
	- `double` is 15
	- This is also known as __Precision__.
	- __Single Precision__ and __Double Precision__ respectively.

### Data Types, Variables, and Assignment Statements

Syntax to declare a variable:
```C++
dataType identifier;
```

Example:
```C++
int counter;
double interestRate;
char grade;
```

Syntax to assign a variable:
```C++
variable = expression;
```
_The expression is evaluated and its value is assigned to `variable`._

### Arithmetic Operators, Operator Precedence, and Expressions

Standard arithmetic operators can manipulate integral and floating-point data types.

These are:
	`+` Addition
	`-` Subtraction
	`*` Multiplication
	`/` Division
	`%` Modulus

Division within integral data types returns the quotient (no remainder).
	- Use modulus to find remainder (only accepts integrals)

Everything but modulus works with both integral and floating-point data types.

#### Order of Precedence

C++ follows order of operations.
	- This includes parentheses.

__Associativity__ of arithmetic operators is left to right
#### Expressions

Three types of arithmetic expressiona:
	- __Integral Expressions__ yields integral result when all operands are integers.
	- __Floating-Point Expressions__ yields a floating-point result when all operands are floating points.
	- __Mixed Expressions__ contain both integers and floating points.

#### Mixed Expressions

Mixed Expressions contain operands of different data types.

Two rules when C++ evaluates mixed expressions:
	1. Integers are converted to floating-point numbers with a 0 in the tenths values. Results in a floating-point number.
	2. Follows precedence rules.

### Type Conversion (Casting)

__Implicit Type Coercion__ is when a value of one data type is automatically changed to another.
	- Be careful as this can cause unexpected results.

__Explicit Type Conversion__ is done through the use of the __Cast Operator__.

The cast operator, a.k.a. __Type Conversion__ or __Type Casting__, takes the form:
```C++
static_cast<dataTypeName> (expression)
```
