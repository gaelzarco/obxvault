# Input âœ§ Output

in C++, I/O is a sequence of bytes, usually chars.

__Stream__ is a sequence of characters from the source to the destination.

__Input Stream__ is a sequence of chars from an input device.

__Output Stream__ is a sequence of chars from the computer to an output device.

`iostream` is necessary for I/O and it contains two data types:
	- `istream` (input stream)
	- `ostream` (output stream)
	- Contains `cin` (common input) and `cout` (common output).

Vars of type `istream` are called __Input Stream Variables__.
	- Extraction Operator

Extraction Operator is binary and takes two operands.
	1. Input stream variable `cin` (left-side)
	2. Variable (right-side)

A single input statement can read more than one data item at a time:
```C++
cin >> payRate >> hoursWorked;

// Equivalent code
cin >> payRate;
cin >> hoursWorked;
```

`cin` examples:
```C++
// Statement 1
cin >> ch; 
// Input
// AB 
// Result
// ch = 'A', 'B' is held for later

// Statement 2
cin >> a >> ch >> z;
// Input
// 57 A 26.9
// Result
// a = 57, ch = 'A', z = 26.9

// Statement 3
cin >> z >> ch >> a;
// Input
// 36.78B34
// Result
// 36.78B34 z = 36.78, ch = 'B',
```
_Unused inputs are discarded, but mismatched data types are not allowed. They will result in **Input Failure**_.

Vars of type `ostream` are called __Output Stream Variables__.
