# Input ✧ Output

### I/O Streams and Standard I/O Devices

in C++, I/O is a sequence of bytes, usually chars.

__Stream__ is a sequence of characters from the source to the destination.

__Input Stream__ is a sequence of chars from an input device.

__Output Stream__ is a sequence of chars from the computer to an output device.

`iostream` is necessary for I/O and it contains two data types:
	- `istream` (input stream)
	- `ostream` (output stream)
	- Contains `cin` (common input) and `cout` (common output).

Vars of type `istream` are called __Input Stream Variables__.
	- Extraction Operator

Extraction Operator is binary and takes two operands.
	1. Input stream variable `cin` (left-side)
	2. Variable (right-side)

A single input statement can read more than one data item at a time:
```C++
cin >> payRate >> hoursWorked;

// Equivalent code
cin >> payRate;
cin >> hoursWorked;
```

`cin` examples:
```C++
// Statement 1
cin >> ch; 
// Input
// AB 
// Result
// ch = 'A', 'B' is held for later

// Statement 2
cin >> a >> ch >> z;
// Input
// 57 A 26.9
// Result
// a = 57, ch = 'A', z = 26.9

// Statement 3
cin >> ķ >> ch >> a;
// Input
// 36.78B34
// Result
// 36.78B34 z = 36.78, ch = 'B',
```
_Unused inputs are discarded, but mismatched data types are not allowed. They will result in **Input Failure**_.

Vars of type `ostream` are called __Output Stream Variables__.

__Stream Member Functions__ or __Stream Functions__:
	- `get`
	- `ignore`
	- `putback`
	- `peek`

### Using Predefined Functions

Functions take in __Arguments__ or __Parameters__.

Calling a function is called a __Function Call__.
	- This causes the function to execute.

Beware of including appropriate header files, argument data types, quantity of arguments, and what a predefined function achieves when using one. 

#### `cin` and `get`

The var `cin` can access the stream function `get`, which is used to read character data.

`get` function inputs the very next character (including whitespace) from input stream and stores it in the memory location indicated by its argument.

`get` syntax:
```C++
cin.get(varChar);
```
_varChar is a `char` variable and is the argument of the function._

You cannot use `get` to store other data types such as `int`.

#### `cin` and `ignore`

`ignore` discards a portion of the input

`ignore` syntax:
```C++
cin.ignore(intExp, chExp);
```
In the example above:
	-  `intExp` is an integer expression yielding an `int` value. This value specifies the max num of chars to ignore in a line.
	- `chExp` is a `char` expression yielding a `char` value. This value specifies which `char` triggers the input to not be ignored anymore.
	- Whichever comes first

#### `putback` and `peek` (137)

`putback` allows you to put the last `char` extracted from the input stream (by `get` function) back into the input stream.

Syntax:
```C++
istreamVar.putback(ch);
```
_`istreamVar` is an input stream variable such as `cin`_.

`peek` allows you to look into the input stream and tells you what `char` is next without removing it from the input stream.
	- Does not mutate input stream.
	- Must be used in assignment statement.

Syntax:
```C++
ch = istreamVar.peek();
```
_`istreamVar` is an input stream variable such as `cin`, `ch` is a `char` variable_.

#### Dot Notation in I/O Stream Variables and I/O Functions: Precaution

Do not call functions without using `.`
```C++
cin.get(ch);    // Correct
cinget(ch);     // Incorrect
```

Functions can be members of a specific data type such as is the case here.
	- `get`, `peek`, etc. are members of the `istream` datatype.

The dot operator is a __Member Access Operator__.

### Input Failure

When an input stream errors, it enters the __Fail State__.
	- Continues to execute the rest of the program regardless of the error which produces erroneous values.
	- Ignores all further I/O operations.

#### `clear`

You can restore the input stream using `clear`.
```C++
istreamVar.clear();
```
_Use `ignore` to clear the rest of the garbage from the input stream._

### Output and Formatting Output

__Manipulators__ are used to format the output
	- `endl`

#### `setprecision`

Controls the output of floating-point numbers.
	- floating-point values default to scientific notation.

`setprecision` set the amount of sig digits:
```C++
setprecision(n);

// Example
cout << setprecision(2);
```
_Must include header file `iomanip`_

#### `fixed`

Outputs floating-point numbers in a fixed decimal format until it is disabled:
```C++
// Enable
cout << fixed;

// Disable
cout.unsetf(ios::fixed);
```
_Output of floating-point numbers returns to default using `unsetf`_

`scientific` is used to output floats in scientific format.

#### `showpoint`

Forces decimal values to show.

Outputs decimals with decimal point and trailing zeros on standard output device:
```C++
cout << showpoint;
```

Outputs floats in a fixed decimal format with decimal point and trailing zeros on standard output device:
```C++
cout << fixed << showpoint;
```

Example program using `setprecision`, `fixed`, and `showpoint`:
![[Pasted image 20250211232229.png]]
Output:
```C++
Line 10: setprecision(2)
Line 11: radius = 12.67
Line 12: height = 12.00
Line 13: volume = 6051.80
Line 14: PI = 3.14

Line 15: setprecision(3)
Line 16: radius = 12.670
Line 17: height = 12.000
Line 18: volume = 6051.797
Line 19: PI = 3.142

Line 20: setprecision(4)
Line 21: radius = 12.6700
Line 22: height = 12.0000
Line 23: volume = 6051.7969
Line 24: PI = 3.1416

Line 25: 12.670, 12.00, 3.14159
```

#### C++14 Digit Separator

`'` (single quote) can be used to separate large digits in C++14:
```C++
cout << 1'2'3'4'5'6'7'8'9'0 << endl;

// Output
// 1234567890
```

#### `setw`

Outputs the value of an expression in a specific number of columns.
	- Value can be string or number

`setw(n)` outputs the value of the next expression in `n` columns.
	- Right-justified
	- A value of 8 would require 4 columns with the first 4 being blank.
	- If value specified is less than # of columns required by output, output automatically expands to the required number of columns (not truncated).

If `x` is an `int` var, this outputs the value of `x` in 5 columns on standard output device:
```C++
cout << setw(5) << x << endl;
```
_Must include `iomanip` header file_

`setw` controls output of next expression, not all output of floating-point numbers like `setprecision`.

### Additional Output Formatting Tools

#### `setfill`

Fills unused columns with a character other than a space:
```C++
cout << setfill('#');
```
_Must include `iomanip` header file_

#### `left` and `right`

Left/right justify output
	- output from `setw` is an example of when you might use this.
```C++
// Enable
cout << left;
cout << setw(2) << x;

// Disable
cout.unset(ios::left);
```
_Same for `right`_

### Input/Output and `string` type

`cin` operator cannot be used to read strings that contain blanks.

`getline` reads a string containing blanks:
	- Reading is delimited by newline char `\n`
	- Does not store `\n` in memory.
	- Does not skip leading whitespace

Syntax:
```C++
getline(cin, strVar);
```

### Logic Errors and Debugging using `cout`

Compiler addresses syntax errors, but not logic errors expect for trivial ones (variable not initialized).

`cout` can be used to output variables and other data when debugging.

### File Input/Output
