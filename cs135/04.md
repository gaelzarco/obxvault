# Control Structure (Selection)

### Control Structures

Three types of program flow:
![[Pasted image 20250226132448.png]]

Two most common control structures:
	- in __Selection__ the program executes statements based on some condition(s).
	- in __Repetition__ the program repeats particular statements a certain number of times based on some condition(s).

#### Selection: `if` and `if..else`

__Logical Expression__ is an expression that evaluates to true or false.

Relational Operators:
	- `==` Equal to
	- `!=` Not equal to
	- `<` Less than
	- `<=` Less than or equal to
	- `>` Greater than
	- `>=` Greater than or equal to

Each relational operator is a binary operator and requires two operands accordingly.
	- Always evaluates to true or false.

#### Relational Operators and Simple Data Types

Relational Operators can be used with any integral data type.

`char` values are evaluated using a machine's collating sequence:
	- `'A' > '0'` Will evaluate to true since `'A'` has an ASCII value of 65 and `'0'` has an ASCII value of 48 (65 > 48). 
	- Because of this, comparing `8 < '5'` will result in false because of the underlying ASCII value of the char `'5'`.

Two branch control structures:
	-  `if` statements
	- `switch` statements (not covered in this chapter)

#### One-Way Selection

Syntax:
```C++
if (expression)
	statement
```
_Expression is commonly referred to as a **Decision Maker** because it decides whether to execute the statement._

Expression consists of a logical expression. Flow of execution:
	- `If (a > b)` ---> true ---> `statement`

Example:
```C++
if (score >= 60)
	grade = 'P';
```
_Parentheses are necessary._

#### Two-Way Selection

Syntax:
```C++
if (expression)
	statement
else
	statement2
```
_If expression is `true`, `statement` executes, otherwise, `statement2`._

Flow of execution:
	- `if (a > b)` ---> true ---> `statement`
	- `if (a > b)` ---> false ---> `statement2`

Example:
```C++
if (hours > 40.0)
	wages = 40.0 * rate + 1.5 * rate * (hours - 40.0);
else
	wages = hours * rate;
```
_Semicolons always follow statements, not expressions._

Errors arise from omitting `else` and adding a separate line of logic like so:
```C++
if (score >= 60)                               // Line 1
	cout << "Passing" << endl;    // Line 2
	cout << "Failing" << endl;      // Line 3
	/*
	 * Both line 2 and 3 execute if the logical expression in line 1 is `true`.
	 * If line 1 is `false`, only line 3 executes.
	 * 
	 * This happens because `if` only controls the execution of line 2 regardless
	 * of indentation/formatting.
	*/ 
// ...
```

#### `int` Data Type and Logical (Boolean) Expressions

Value of logical expressions can be stored in an `int` data type.
	- True values are nâˆˆR, n>0;

Example:
```C++
int legalAge;
int age;

legalAge = 21;

// If legalAge is a logical var, you can write it as:
legalAge = (age >= 21);     // Asigns 1 to legalAge if true, otherwise 0
// 1 evaluates to true and 0 evaluates to false
```

Something to note is that while `!(!true)` evaluates to true, `!(!36)` evaluates to 0.
	- As a logical expression `36` evaluates to `1`, so `!(36)` evaluates to `0` and `!(!36) = !(0) = 1`.

#### `bool` Data Type and Logical (Boolean) Expressions

`bool` is C++ built-in data type for logical values `true` or `false`.

Evaluates to `0` or `1`, similar to to using `int` for logical values.

#### Logical (Boolean) Operators and Logical Expressions

__Logical (Boolean) Operators__ allow you to combine and form logical expressions using logical expressions as components.

C++ has three logical (Boolean) operators:
	- `!` _not_
	- `&&` _and_
	- `||` _or_

`!` is a unary operator and only requires one operand. `&&` and `||` are binary operators.

Examples of logical expressions using logical operators:
```C++
!('A' > 'B')                          // True
!(6 <=7)                           // False
(14 >= 5) && ('A' < 'B')    // True
(14 >= 5) && ('A' < 'B')    // False
(14 >= 5) || ('A' > 'B')      // True
(14 >= 5) || ('A' > 'B')      // True
```
