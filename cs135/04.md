# Control Structures I (Selection)

### Control Structures

Three types of program flow:
![[Pasted image 20250226132448.png]]

Two most common control structures:
	- in __Selection__ the program executes statements based on some condition(s).
	- in __Repetition__ the program repeats particular statements a certain number of times based on some condition(s).

#### Selection: `if` and `if..else`

__Logical Expression__ is an expression that evaluates to true or false.

Relational Operators:
	- `==` Equal to
	- `!=` Not equal to
	- `<` Less than
	- `<=` Less than or equal to
	- `>` Greater than
	- `>=` Greater than or equal to

Each relational operator is a binary operator and requires two operands accordingly.
	- Always evaluates to true or false.

#### Relational Operators and Simple Data Types

Relational Operators can be used with any integral data type.

`char` values are evaluated using a machine's collating sequence:
	- `'A' > '0'` Will evaluate to true since `'A'` has an ASCII value of 65 and `'0'` has an ASCII value of 48 (65 > 48). 
	- Because of this, comparing `8 < '5'` will result in false because of the underlying ASCII value of the char `'5'`.

Two branch control structures:
	-  `if` statements
	- `switch` statements (not covered in this chapter)

#### One-Way Selection

Syntax:
```C++
if (expression)
	statement
```
_Expression is commonly referred to as a **Decision Maker** because it decides whether to execute the statement._

Expression consists of a logical expression. Flow of execution:
	- `If (a > b)` ---> true ---> `statement`

Example:
```C++
if (score >= 60)
	grade = 'P';
```
_Parentheses are necessary._

#### Two-Way Selection

Syntax:
```C++
if (expression)
	statement
else
	statement2
```
_If expression is `true`, `statement` executes, otherwise, `statement2`._

Flow of execution:
	- `if (a > b)` ---> true ---> `statement`
	- `if (a > b)` ---> false ---> `statement2`

Example:
```C++
if (hours > 40.0)
	wages = 40.0 * rate + 1.5 * rate * (hours - 40.0);
else
	wages = hours * rate;
```
_Semicolons always follow statements, not expressions._

Errors arise from omitting `else` and adding a separate line of logic like so:
```C++
if (score >= 60)                               // Line 1
	cout << "Passing" << endl;    // Line 2
	cout << "Failing" << endl;      // Line 3
	/*
	 * Both line 2 and 3 execute if the logical expression in line 1 is `true`.
	 * If line 1 is `false`, only line 3 executes.
	 * 
	 * This happens because `if` only controls the execution of line 2 regardless
	 * of indentation/formatting.
	*/ 
// ...
```

#### `int` Data Type and Logical (Boolean) Expressions

Value of logical expressions can be stored in an `int` data type.
	- True values are nâˆˆR, n>0;

Example:
```C++
int legalAge;
int age;

legalAge = 21;

// If legalAge is a logical var, you can write it as:
legalAge = (age >= 21);     // Asigns 1 to legalAge if true, otherwise 0
// 1 evaluates to true and 0 evaluates to false
```

Something to note is that while `!(!true)` evaluates to true, `!(!36)` evaluates to 0.
	- As a logical expression `36` evaluates to `1`, so `!(36)` evaluates to `0` and `!(!36) = !(0) = 1`.

#### `bool` Data Type and Logical (Boolean) Expressions

`bool` is C++ built-in data type for logical values `true` or `false`.

Evaluates to `0` or `1`, similar to to using `int` for logical values.

#### Logical (Boolean) Operators and Logical Expressions

__Logical (Boolean) Operators__ allow you to combine and form logical expressions using logical expressions as components.

C++ has three logical (Boolean) operators:
	- `!` _not_
	- `&&` _and_
	- `||` _or_

`!` is a unary operator and only requires one operand. `&&` and `||` are binary operators.

Examples of logical expressions using logical operators:
```C++
!('A' > 'B')                          // True
!(6 <=7)                           // False
(14 >= 5) && ('A' < 'B')    // True
(14 >= 5) && ('A' < 'B')    // False
(14 >= 5) || ('A' > 'B')      // True
(14 >= 5) || ('A' > 'B')      // True
```

#### Order of Precedence

![[Pasted image 20250303111710.png]]

Because relational and logical operators are evaluated from left to right, the __Associativity__ is of these operators is said to be from left to right.

### Relational Operators and the `string` type

`string` variables are compared character by character using ASCII collating sequence.

#### Compound Statements

__Compound Statements__ consists of one or more statements enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

Example:
```C++
if (age >= 18) {
	cout << "Eligible to vote." << endl;
	cout << "No longer a minor." << endl; 
}
```

#### Multiple Selections: Nested `if`

You can include multiple selection paths in a program by nesting control statements within another.

Example:
```C++
if (balance > 50000.00)
	interestRate = 0.07;
else
	if (balance >= 25000.00)
		interestRate = 0.05;
	else
		if (balance >= 1000.00)
			interestRate = 0.03;
		else
			interestRate = 0.00;
```

A better way to write it:
```C++
if (balance > 50000.00)
	interestRate = 0.07;
else if (balance >= 25000.00)
	interestRate = 0.05;
else if (balance >= 1000.00)
	interestRate = 0.03;
else
	interestRate = 0.00;
```

### Comparing `if..else` Statements with a Series of `if` Statements

```C++
// Program A
if (month == 1) 
	cout << "January" << endl; 
else if (month == 2) 
	cout << "February" << endl; 
else if (month == 3)
	cout << "March" << endl; 
else if (month == 4) 
	cout << "April" << endl; 
else if (month == 5)
	cout << "May" << endl; 
else if (month == 6)
	cout << "June" << endl;

// Program B
if (month == 1)
	cout << "January" << endl;
if (month == 2)
	cout << "February" << endl;
if (month == 3)
	cout << "March" << endl;
if (month == 4)
	cout << "April" << endl;
if (month = 5)
	cout << "May" << endl;
if (month == 6)
	cout << "June" << endl;
```

In program `b`, the computer has to evaluate the expression in each if statement because there is no `else` statement.
	- program `b` executes more slowly than does program `a`.

In a sequence of if . . . else statements, such as `a`, if more than one condition is `true`, only the statements associated with the first true condition will be executed.
	- The control structure is exited after completing the first true condition.

#### Short-Circuit Evaluation

__Short-Circuit Evaluation__ (of a logical expression) is the process in which the computer evaluates a logical expression from left to right and stops as soon as the final value of the expression is known.

#### Comparing Floating-Point Numbers for Equality: A Precaution

It is important to keep in mind that comparing the absolute value of the difference between two floating-point numbers and set tolerance can achieve a viable result to verify if said numbers are 'equal enough'.
	- `fabs` function from the `cmath` library allows you to calculate absolute difference in floating-point numbers.

#### Associativity of Relational Operators: A Precaution

Use proper logical operators when programming logical expressions.

Example:
```C++
// Use
(0 <= num && num <= 10)

// Avoid
(0 <= num <= 10)
/*
* The Reason for this is that this expression evaluates to:
* ((1 or 0) <= 10) since the first part, 0 <= num, evaluates to 1 or 0.
* The second part, (1 or 0) <= 10, will always be true.
*/
```

#### Input Failure and the `if` Statement

When an input stream enters a fail state, all subsequent input statements associated with the input stream are ignored.

Methods to verify integrity of input streams:
```C++
// input stream
if (cin)
	cout << "Input is OK." << endl;

// ifstream variable
if (!inFIle)
	cout << "Input failed." << endl;
```

You can use `return` to exit the program using the value of `1` to indicate that there was an error in attempting to run your code.
	- This value is interpreted by the operating system.

Example:
```C++
ifstream infile;

infile.open("inputdat.dat");

if (!infile) {
	cout << "Cannot open the input file. " << "The program terminates." << endl;
	return 1;    // Return an error to the operating system
}
```

#### Conditional Operator (?:)

Also known as the __Ternary Operator__, is written as `?:`.

Syntax:
```C++
expression1 ? expression2 : expression3
```

If `expression1` evaluates to a nonzero integer (true), then result is `expression2`. Otherwise, the result of the condition expression is `expression3`.

Example:
```C++
// Before using ternary operator
if (a >= b)
	max = a;
else
	max = b;

// After
max = (a >= b) ? a : b;
```
_Both forms are valid and evaluate to the same thing._

### `switch` Structures

__Switch Structure__ does not require the evaluation of a logical expression.
	- Enables the computer to choose from many alternatives.
	- Can be nested similarly to `if` and `if..else` statements.

Execution of a `switch` statement:
![[Pasted image 20250303121151.png]]

The value of the expression is used to chose and perform actions specified in the statements that follow the reserved word `case`.
	- This expression is sometimes referred to as the __Selector__.

Syntax:
```C++
switch (expression) {
case value1:
	statements1
	break;
case value2:
	statements2
	break;
case value3:
	statements3
	break;
	.
	.
	.
default:
	statements
}
```

Rules of execution:
	1. Statements in a `case` value execute until either a `break` statement is found or the end of the `switch` structure is reached.
	2. If the value of `expression` does not match any `case` values, the statements in the `default` value execute. If no `default`, `switch` statement value is `null`.
	3. `break` statement causes an immediate _exit_ from the `switch` structure.

Examples:
```C++
// Everything 5 and below is F
// 10 and 9 are an A
// Defaults to a output warning
switch (score / 10) {
case 0:
case 1:
case 2:
case 3:
case 4:
case 5:
	grade = 'F';
	break;
case 6:
	grade = 'D';
	break;
case 7:
	grade = 'C';
	break;
case 8:
	grade = 'B';
	break;
case 9:
case 10:
	grade = 'A';
	break;
default:
	cout << "Invalid test score." << endl;
}
```
```C++
// Logical value evaluation as expression
switch (age >= 18) {
case 1:
	cout << "Old enough to be drafted." << endl;
	cout << "Old enough to vote." << endl;
	break;
case 0:
	cout << "Not old enough to be drafted." << endl;
	cout << "Not old enough to vote." << endl;
}
```

### Terminating a Program with the `assert` Function

`assert` is useful to stop program's execution when certain errors occur.
	- Enables the display of an error message indicating the type of error and where the error occurred.
	- Requires `cassert` library

Syntax:
```C++
#include <cassert>

assert(expression);
```

`expression` if any logical expression.
	- if true, the next statement executes.

Example:
```C++
// Prevent division by 0
// If denominator is 0, assert halts the program's execution
// Can be written as:
// assert(denominator != 0);
assert(denominator);
quotient = numerator / denominator;
```

Output:
```
Assertion failed: denominator, file c:\temp\assert
\function\assertfunction.cpp, line 20
```

Can be disabled by using the following preprocessor directive:
```C++
#define NDEBUG;
```
_Must be placed before `#include <cassert>` directive._
