# Control Structures II (Repetition)

C++ has three repetition, or looping, structures that allow you to repeat a set of statement until certain conditions are men.
### `while` Looping (Repetition) Structure

Syntax:
```C++
while (expression)
	statement
```
_Statement can be a simple or compound statement._

Execution Flow:

`expression` acts as a __Decision Maker__ and is usually a logical expression.
	- provides an entry condition to the loop.
	- If initially `true`, loop starts.
	- Re-evaluates on each iteration, continues if `true`.
	- Exits loop when `false`.

__Infinite Loops__ are loops that execute endlessly (no exit case).

`statement` is the body of the loop.

Example Program:
```C++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int calBurnedInADay;
	int calBurnedInAWeek;
	int day;
	
	day = 1;
	calBurnedInAWeek = 0;
	
	while (day <= 7) {
		cout << "Enter calories burned day " << day << ": ";
		cin >> calBurnedInADay;
		cout << endl;
		calBurnedInAWeek = calBurnedInAWeek + calBurnedInADay;
		day = day + 1;
	}
	
	cout << "Average number of calories burned each day: "
	<< calBurnedInAWeek / 7 << endl;
	
	return 0;
}
```

`day` in the example program above is known as the __Loop Control Variable (LCV)__.

LCVs:
	1. Must be initialized before the `while` loop.
	2. Must result in a `false` expression evaluation at a certain point.

Be careful of where in the loop, LCVs are manipulated. This can change the behavior of the loop.

#### Case 1: Counter-Controlled `while` Loops

__Counter-Controlled `while` Loop__ is a `while` loop in which the LCV serves as a _counter_ that dictates how many times the loop iterates or executes.
	- That is, statement is executed _n_ times.

_counter_ is compared to _n_.

Overview example:
```C++
counter = 0;

while (counter < N) {
	// Code that does something...
	counter++
}
```

#### Case 2: Sentinel-Controlled `while` Loops
